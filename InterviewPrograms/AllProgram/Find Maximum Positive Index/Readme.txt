You are given an array A. We define a term Positive difference index as the count of elements between the two indexes i and j (both inclusive) such that i<j and A[i]<A[j]. Now for the given array, you have to find the maximum positive difference index. It is assured that the test case will be valid such that there exists an answer.

Input format

First line : T i.e Number of test cases. For each test case : First line : N Second line : N space separated integers denoting the element of the array.

Output format

Print the answer to each test case in a separate line and it is given that answer always exists.

Sample Input
1
6
5 3 2 1 1 4

Sample Output
5

Explanation
let i=2 and j=6 then A[i]<A[j] and total elements between them is 5 so the maximum answer that can be achieved is 5.
